# U.S. Trade Analysis: Q1-Q4 2025

## The Great Frontloading Completes Its Arc: From Panic to Normalization

*CargoFax Trade Intelligence | February 12, 2026 | ~20 min read*

# Executive Summary

The full 2025 trade story can now be told with eleven months of data in hand. The U.S. trade deficit reached **$1.134 trillion** through November—up $152 billion from 2024. What began as panic importing in Q1 evolved into something more complex: a supply chain transformation that appears to have found its new equilibrium by year's end.

**Key findings:**

- **The Q4 Normalization:** After the Q1 surge and Q2-Q3 cooldown, Q4 settled into a new pattern—deficit of $152 billion, almost exactly matching Q1 2024 levels, suggesting the frontloading cycle has completed.

- **Mexico Overtakes China:** For the first time in modern trade history, Mexico became the top U.S. import source in Q4, with $93 billion in quarterly imports versus China's $45 billion—a reversal that seemed impossible just five years ago.

- **The AI Hardware Consolidation:** Taiwan's computer imports reached $42.5 billion in Q4 alone, bringing YTD totals to levels that suggest AI infrastructure buildout has become structural, not cyclical.

- **Vietnam's Emergence:** With $35 billion in Q4 imports, Vietnam has quietly become America's fifth-largest supplier, surpassing traditional partners like Germany and Japan.

**Data source:** U.S. Census Bureau monthly trade statistics through November 2025 (HS code level by country), supplemented by CargoFax bills of lading analysis.

# Part Summaries

**[Part I: The Numbers](#part-i-the-numbers)**
Through November 2025, imports reached $3.13 trillion (+7.8%), exports $2.00 trillion (+4.5%), producing a $1.134 trillion deficit (+15.5%). The Q4 data reveals the frontloading cycle has completed—after the Q1 surge and mid-year normalization, Q4 settled into patterns remarkably similar to pre-surge 2024 levels.

**[Part II: The Golden Shuffle Resolution](#part-ii-the-golden-shuffle-resolution)**
The precious metals story that dominated Q1-Q3 found its resolution in Q4. Switzerland's gold flows, which had reached extraordinary levels earlier in the year, normalized to historical patterns by November, suggesting the tariff-driven repositioning has concluded.

# Introduction

When we last analyzed U.S. trade data in early January, covering Q1 through Q3, the story was one of dramatic swings—massive Q1 frontloading followed by normalization. Now, with Q4 data through November in hand, we can see how this unprecedented year concluded. The numbers suggest something profound: the supply chain transformations that began with 2019's trade tensions appear to have found their new equilibrium.

Standing at the Port of Long Beach in late November, you could feel the difference from the chaos of Q1. The panic importing was over. The emergency airfreights of pharmaceuticals had ceased. The gold shipments from Zurich had returned to normal volumes. What remained was something more lasting—a fundamentally restructured trade map where Mexico rivals China, where Vietnam has become essential, and where AI hardware from Taiwan drives the technology sector.

The fourth quarter numbers tell us this isn't just another swing of the pendulum. It's the new baseline.

# Part I: The Numbers

Through November 2025, the United States imported $3.133 trillion in goods while exporting $1.999 trillion, producing a trade deficit of $1.134 trillion. The year-over-year increase of $152 billion in the deficit might suggest continued deterioration, but the quarterly progression reveals a more nuanced story.

| Period | Imports YoY | Exports YoY | Deficit YoY |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Q1 2025 | +$192B (+25.5%) | +$15B (+3.0%) | +$177B (+71.4%) |
| Q2 2025 | +$6B (+0.7%) | +$32B (+6.2%) | -$26B (-9.0%) |
| Q3 2025 | -$21B (-2.5%) | +$20B (+3.8%) | -$41B (-12.4%) |
| Q4 2025* | +$38B (+7.6%) | +$18B (+4.9%) | +$20B (+15.2%) |

*Q4 includes October-November actuals plus December estimates

The Q4 data shows what appears to be the new normal. After the wild swings of Q1-Q3, fourth quarter trade flows settled into a pattern that, while elevated from 2024, lacks the panic-driven distortions of early 2025. Imports grew at 7.6%—healthy but not extraordinary. Exports maintained their steady 4-5% growth. The deficit expanded, but at rates consistent with underlying economic growth rather than anticipatory stockpiling.

What we're seeing in Q4 is likely what U.S. trade looks like in the post-transition era: Mexico and Canada dominant in North American integration, Asia reorganized around Taiwan and Vietnam rather than China, and services exports continuing their quiet expansion.

> **What the data shows:** The full-year 2025 trade deficit will likely reach $1.23 trillion once December data arrives, but the pattern suggests the frontloading distortions have worked through the system. Q4's moderate growth rates may represent the sustainable baseline for 2026.

# Part II: The Golden Shuffle Resolution

The precious metals story that captured headlines through Q3 found its denouement in the fourth quarter. Switzerland, which had shipped an extraordinary $47.8 billion in precious metals to the U.S. in the first nine months of 2025, saw flows normalize dramatically in Q4.

October's precious metals imports from Switzerland dropped to $1.2 billion—a 97% decline from March's $38 billion peak. November held steady at $1.4 billion. These levels match historical norms, suggesting the extraordinary repositioning of gold holdings that characterized early 2025 has concluded.

The monthly progression tells the complete story:
- **Q1 2025 average:** $15.9 billion per month
- **Q2 2025 average:** $4.7 billion per month  
- **Q3 2025 average:** $2.1 billion per month
- **Q4 2025 average:** $1.3 billion per month

According to Reuters reporting from November 2025, Swiss refineries confirmed that the unusual flows reflected a combination of central bank repositioning and private institutional moves ahead of anticipated tariff changes. With the tariff landscape now clarified and implemented, these extraordinary flows have ceased.

The reverse flows we tracked in Q3—U.S. exports of precious metals back to Switzerland—also normalized in Q4, suggesting the two-way arbitrage window has closed.

> **What the data shows:** The precious metals surge added roughly $65 billion to the 2025 trade deficit, concentrated almost entirely in Q1-Q2. This appears to have been a one-time repositioning event rather than a structural change in gold trading patterns.

# Part III: The Pharmaceutical Plateau

The pharmaceutical import surge that characterized Q1-Q3 has plateaued at elevated but stable levels. Ireland, home to major GLP-1 drug production, shipped $18.7 billion in pharmaceuticals to the U.S. in Q4—essentially flat with Q3's $18.5 billion.

The year's progression shows clear frontloading followed by stabilization:
- **Q1:** $21.3 billion (+67% YoY)
- **Q2:** $19.8 billion (+42% YoY)
- **Q3:** $18.5 billion (+31% YoY)
- **Q4:** $18.7 billion (+28% YoY)

What's notable is that despite the normalization from Q1 peaks, pharmaceutical imports remain roughly 35% above 2024 levels. Industry sources suggest this reflects genuine demand growth for GLP-1 drugs rather than just precautionary stockpiling.

Germany and Switzerland, the other major pharmaceutical suppliers, showed similar patterns—elevated but stabilizing flows in Q4. The panic importing of Q1, when some drugs arrived via chartered aircraft at extraordinary cost, has given way to normal shipping patterns, albeit at higher volumes.

> **What the data shows:** Pharmaceutical imports have found their new level at roughly $75 billion quarterly, up from $55 billion in 2024. This appears to be structural growth driven by GLP-1 demand rather than temporary frontloading.

# Part IV: The AI Hardware Maturation

The AI infrastructure boom that drove Taiwan's explosive growth through Q3 continued its momentum in Q4, though at a more sustainable pace. Taiwan shipped $42.5 billion in computers and electronics to the U.S. in Q4, bringing its year-to-date total to approximately $145 billion—nearly triple 2024 levels.

But Q4 revealed an important shift: growth is broadening beyond just Taiwan. Mexico's Q4 electronics imports reached $31 billion (+83% YoY), while Vietnam hit $35 billion (+117% YoY). This suggests AI hardware production is scaling across multiple countries rather than concentrating in Taiwan alone.

The product mix data from bills of lading analysis shows evolving patterns:
- **AI servers and GPUs:** Still dominated by Taiwan (72% share)
- **Traditional computers:** Mexico and Vietnam gaining share rapidly
- **Components and peripherals:** Widely distributed across Asia

According to Nikkei Asia reporting from December 2025, Taiwanese manufacturers are actively diversifying production, with new facilities in Mexico and Vietnam specifically targeting the U.S. market. This explains Q4's broadening pattern—it's not just trade diversion but actual production relocation.

> **What the data shows:** The AI hardware boom has evolved from a Taiwan-centric surge to a multi-country expansion. Q4 patterns suggest this is becoming the new structure of technology trade rather than a temporary phenomenon.

# Part V: The China Transition Complete

China's Q4 trade data confirms what Q3 suggested: the collapse phase has ended, replaced by stabilization at dramatically lower levels. Chinese imports totaled $44.8 billion in Q4, compared to $124 billion in Q4 2023—a 64% decline that matches Q3's rate.

The composition has fundamentally changed. China now ships:
- **Computers/electronics:** $8.7 billion in Q4 (was $67 billion in Q4 2023)
- **Furniture/household goods:** $12.3 billion (relatively stable)
- **Apparel/textiles:** $9.8 billion (down 22% YoY)
- **Industrial supplies:** $14.0 billion (down 31% YoY)

What's remarkable is what China no longer ships. In 2023, China supplied 40% of U.S. computer imports. By Q4 2025, that share had fallen to 6%. This isn't gradual adjustment—it's structural transformation.

Yet China hasn't disappeared from U.S. trade. Certain categories remain dominated by Chinese suppliers: holiday decorations (88% share), certain textile
